# KPointer
Project of mine. Create presentations and run it as an executable. Transition using various commands.


## TO DO:

### OpenCV:  (Or try OpenVX)
    . Video(or image) overlay over video.
      .. Loop until video 1 finishes.
      .. 
    
### Audio
    . Audio in sync with video.
    . Change audio on input. 
    . Blend audio in and out.
    
### Separate files and chapters:
    . Only load and open the 
    . Organization into segments. Each segment may be composed of:
            - Intro (Like a title, a image, looped video or a video itself)
            - Main body
            
    . Format of a segment
            - Tittle screen: just show the tittle of what is to come.
            - Point by point exposition. (Power point style) On continue it might trigger
            - Video

### Navigation.
    . Forward, backward, pause, trigger calls in each module. The idea is to be able to jump to different
    events depending on the present segment.
    . Video TimeStamps, pause or trigger something passed a time marker.

### UI to create Presentations faster.
    . A system to link segments, events, transitions, ...  faster
    
### Transition system.
    . A section can transition after end or on a external trigger.
    . If not, the section can loop or keep music on a static image... something smooth.
    . Fade off or some other effect and blend audio.
    
### Some Audio triggers or other external triggers?


### Have another device helping in the process.

### Main differences with MainStream tools. (PWP, AE as a video montage, ...)
    . Able to pause.
    . End of segment is a looped 'gif' or a image 
## Foreseen Issues.
  . Audio and video desync:
      We are processing video
      
  . Audio 
  
  . Preloadsss
  
  . Possible renames: PointShow, Hay, Drai,

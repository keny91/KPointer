# KPointer
Project of mine. Create presentations and run it as an executable. Transition using various commands.


## TO DO:

### OpenCV:  
    . Video(or image) overlay over video.
      .. Loop until video 1 finishes.
      .. 
    
### Audio
    . Audio in sync with video.
    . Change audio on input. 
    . Blend audio in and out.
    
### Separate files and chapters:
    . Only load and open the 
    
### Transition system.
    . A section can transition after end or on a external trigger.
    . If not, the section can loop or keep music on a static image... something smooth.
    . Fade off or some other effect and blend audio.
    
### Some Audio triggers or other external triggers?


### Have another device helping in the process.

Foreseen Issues.
